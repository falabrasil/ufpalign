# Experiments with Kaldi chain vs. no chain nnet3

These experiments were performed following the recipe `fb-ufpalign` on
`kaldi-br` repo (former `fb-librispeech`.)
The alignment was performed with scripts versioned on the same
repo, which have now been transferred to UFPAlign's simulation dir, but
unfortunately can't be reproduced without adjusting a lot of path to
intermediate resources.
Right now it takes some time to fix, which I'm afraid I won't have anymore.
